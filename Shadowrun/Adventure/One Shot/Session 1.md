## The Planning (Dec 21)
- Team disbursed to see if their individual talents can plan the heist effectively.
- ### Golem
	- took the sewers to get past security checkpoints.
	- Went to the physical location to see what is what. 
		- saw 4 Flying drones that follow the 4 corners of the building to keep the exterior of the building under constant surveillance.
		- saw land drones (Nissan Dobermans) that were operating on the inside of the building.
		- actual personal security seems pretty lite.
- ### Hairy
	- Created some uniforms that look like they the Cryonix Medical Solutions worker uniforms.
	- Did a search for vault schematics to get an idea of what the security on the vault would look like. 
		- He was able to find them and get a load out of what the keys neede are. 
			- One biometric data (either a finger print, hand print, eye scan or combination there of)
			- a numeric sequence that changes on a regular basis
		- Hair Glitched and accidentally dowloaded Malware in his cyber eye that pops up at inconvenient moments.
	- Hairy wanted to go to the party, but is an introvert.
- ### Maestro
	- Connected with a contact who has the ability to forge fake entry keys to get into the building.
	- spent some time in the area scoping out the most frequented bar by the corporate drones.
	- Goes to the Club with Hotshot and crashes the Cryonix Holiday Party. 
		- Figures out the over all hierarchy of the company using military terms (Generals, Sergeants and privates.) as she doesn't have a corporate background, just merc.
		- Strikes out in seduction
		- Is able to lift a glass that has a hand print of a "general" in the company.
- ### Hotshot
	- Hotshot was using her engineering background to be able to build some sort of containment system for the **Specimen S13** serum, that she thinks should keep it cold enough long enough to deliver.
	- Goes to the Club with Maestro and crashes the Cryonix Holiday Party.
		- Is able to chat up a lab technician and get some more information of **Specimen S13**
			- the serum is a metalic purple color
			- It becomes an unstable gas when it >= 0 degrees C and no container can hold it, it just evaporates and dissipates no matter how tightly sealed it is.
		- Hotshot succeeded in seduction.
## They all finished for the night and will reconvene the next day at a their regular haunt.
