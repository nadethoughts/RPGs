This setup is excellent for a one-shot, with clear stakes and a tight timeframe. Here's a way to flesh out the adventure:

### **1. Initial Briefing**
### Location: **"The Circuit"**

Tucked away in the industrial sprawl of Tacoma, **The Circuit** is a neon-lit dive bar catering to the shadows. Known for its no-questions-asked policy and pay-per-minute data terminals, the bar is a hub for deckers, fixers, and mercs alike. The interior features mismatched furniture, holo-screens broadcasting illegal Urban Brawl matches. The constant hum of nearby factories adds to the ambiance, masking the whispers of clandestine negotiations.

The Johnson contacts the team through a fixer and arranges a meet at a discreet location, **The Circuit** via a  private back room in a high-tech nightclub or a quiet, upscale café. During the meeting, the Johnson emphasizes:

- The need for subtlety: If the theft is discovered or traced, the operation's success and their payment will be jeopardized.
- Strict deadline: The serum must be acquired during the end-of-year holiday period, as the lab will have reduced security and staffing.
- Bonus potential: Additional rewards for leaving no trace or making it look like an internal theft.

**Key info provided:**

- Lab location: **Cryonix Medical Solutions**’ in Bellevue.
- Security details: Sparse during the holidays but still formidable, including drones, automated turrets, and a skeleton crew of guards and researchers.
- Entry points: Front entrance (heavily guarded), a rooftop vent system, and a rarely-used loading dock.

### **2. Planning Phase**

Allow players time to gather intel and gear. Possible leads include:

- **Matrix Research:** Hacking to gather blueprints, find security schedules, and identify vulnerabilities.
- **Legwork:** Interrogating or bribing staff for insider knowledge.
- **Recon:** Scouting the site with drones or magic.

Potential discoveries:

- A hidden sewer tunnel connecting to the lab’s basement, partially submerged but potentially viable for stealthy entry.
- Security exploits, like a distracted guard who tends to leave their post for unscheduled smoke breaks.
- A time window where a routine system reboot will briefly disable cameras.

### **3. The Infiltration**

The lab is designed as a high-tech facility, with cold, sterile corridors and dimly-lit labs. Possible challenges include:

- **Security Systems:** Laser tripwires, pressure-sensitive floors, and biometric locks.
- **Guards and Drones:** A skeleton crew on patrol, but well-trained and armed.
- **Environmental Hazards:** A malfunctioning cryogenic storage system leaking dangerous vapors or a room flooded with toxic chemicals.

**Optional complications:**

- An unexpected third-party break-in (a rival corp’s team or an eco-terrorist group).
- A rogue AI controlling part of the lab’s defenses.
- A curious researcher working overtime who might stumble upon the team.

### **4. The Serum**

The serum is stored in a high-security lab with reinforced doors, multiple layers of encryption, and possibly magical defenses. Players might need:

- A hacker to disable alarms and locks.
- A magician to deal with astral wards or spirits.
- A face or infiltrator to bluff their way past a researcher.

**Twist:**  
The serum is highly unstable, requiring special storage or constant cooling. This adds urgency and forces the team to adapt if their extraction plan falters.

### **5. The Escape**

Once the serum is secured, players must exfiltrate without drawing attention. Complications could include:

- A security sweep triggered by a failed stealth roll.
- The arrival of corporate reinforcements due to a silent alarm.
- Navigating the hostile environment, such as firefights or sabotaged routes.

### **6. Epilogue**

The runners deliver the serum to the Johnson at a pre-arranged drop-off point. Depending on their performance:

- Full payout if no one suspects a theft.
- Reduced payment if their presence or the nature of the theft is detected.
- Potential betrayal if the Johnson decides they’re loose ends or if the serum was tampered with during the run.
