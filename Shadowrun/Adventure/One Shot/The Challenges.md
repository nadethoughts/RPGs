To infiltrate the Cryonix Medical Solutions lab in Bellevue without incident, the team will face several potential challenges. These problems can be customized to your players' skills, ensuring a balance of difficulty and engagement. Here’s a breakdown:

---

### **1. Pre-Mission Challenges**

**Surveillance and Intel Gathering:**

- Problem: The team must gather intelligence about the lab's layout, security measures, and schedules.
- Solutions:
    - Hacking into Cryonix's servers for blueprints and schedules.
    - Using drones or physical surveillance to observe the lab and its surroundings.
    - Social engineering (e.g., posing as maintenance workers or delivery personnel).

**Fake Credentials and Cover Stories:**

- Problem: The team needs valid SINs or disguises to avoid suspicion when entering Bellevue, especially if traveling from less affluent districts.
- Solutions:
    - Forge fake credentials or bribe contacts to provide authentic-looking passes.
    - Plan a cover story that withstands basic scrutiny from security personnel.

**Transportation and Parking:**

- Problem: Bellevue has restricted parking, and security checkpoints monitor vehicles.
- Solutions:
    - Use a rigger’s stealthy vehicle or rent a nondescript car.
    - Avoid checkpoints by entering on foot through less monitored access points.

### **2. Immediate Environment**

**Perimeter Security:**

- Problem: Cameras, drones, and guard patrols monitor the lab’s perimeter.
- Solutions:
    - A Decker disables or loops security cameras and drone feeds.
    - An Infiltrator scouts patrol routes to avoid detection.
    - Use stealth gear, such as chameleon suits or optical camouflage.

**Checkpoints and Access Cards:**

- Problem: Cryonix uses biometric scanners or keycards to restrict access.
- Solutions:
    - Acquire keycards from employees through pickpocketing or blackmail.
    - Hack or spoof biometric scanners with specialized gear.

### **3. Lab Interior Challenges**

**Security Patrols:**

- Problem: Interior guards follow irregular patrol routes.
- Solutions:
    - Use distractions (e.g., triggering an alarm elsewhere).
    - Knock out guards silently and hide their bodies.
    - Monitor routes using hacked security feeds.

**Locked Doors and Elevators:**

- Problem: Many areas are protected by maglocks, passcodes, or mechanical locks.
- Solutions:
    - Use maglock passkeys or a Decker to bypass electronic locks.
    - Have an Infiltrator or locksmith handle physical barriers.

**Hidden Sensors and Alarms:**

- Problem: Motion sensors, pressure plates, and alarmed doors can reveal the team's presence.
- Solutions:
    - Detect sensors using a scanner or magical detection spells.
    - Use hacking, precision movement, or drones to bypass sensitive areas.

### **4. Specialized Challenges**

**Cryogenic Storage Access:**

- Problem: The serum is stored in a high-security cryogenic vault requiring specialized tools to open safely.
- Solutions:
    - Acquire the correct tools or codes through research or social engineering.
    - Use a Mage to counter magical wards protecting the vault.

**Data Wiping:**

- Problem: To cover their tracks, the team might need to erase or manipulate Cryonix’s records.
- Solutions:
    - A Decker accesses the server room to delete or alter data logs.
    - Use explosives or EMPs as a last resort, though this risks exposure.

**Time Pressure:**

- Problem: The lab might have timed security sweeps or updates, forcing the team to move quickly.
- Solutions:
    - Plan a precise timeline during the intel phase.
    - Use distractions to extend or disrupt security response times.

### **5. Exfiltration Challenges**

**Increased Security Response:**

- Problem: If the team is detected, reinforcements or drones may block escape routes.
- Solutions:
    - Prepare contingency plans, such as alternate exits or emergency vehicles.
    - Have a combat specialist cover the team’s retreat.

**Hiding What Was Taken:**

- Problem: Cryonix cannot know what was stolen to maintain the Johnson’s plan.
- Solutions:
    - Plant false evidence (e.g., a decoy serum or data files).
    - Remove additional items to confuse investigators about the team's intent.
