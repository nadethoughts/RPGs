### **Drones in _Shadowrun_:**

Drones are unmanned vehicles that can be operated by riggers or function autonomously. Although any vehicle or machine with a rigger interface can be operated by a rigger, drones are typically more specialized and affordable. They are commonly used for reconnaissance, combat, and surveillance due to their versatility and low cost. Drones are unique in that they are always a part of the Matrix and can be hacked, though when a rigger is jumped into a drone, they become a harder target for hackers.

#### **Drones in the Matrix:**

- **Matrix Presence:** Drones are Matrix devices, which means they can be accessed and controlled via the Matrix. If a rigger is jumped into a drone, the drone's Matrix icon and the rigger’s icon merge. The rigger’s persona becomes the target, rather than the drone itself. If the rigger is not jumped in, the drone is a valid Matrix target.
- **Device Rating:** The Device Rating of a drone is equal to its Pilot Rating, and it determines its Matrix attributes like Firewall, Data Processing, and Signal. These attributes help determine how well the drone can operate in the Matrix and how resistant it is to being hacked.

#### **Pilot Programs:**

- **Pilot Programs:** Drones are controlled by basic AI programs called pilot programs, which are simple and don’t respond well to novel situations. The Pilot Rating (linked to the drone's Device Rating) is used in place of the drone's mental attributes for tests.
- **Pilot Program Limitations:** Pilots are not very bright and have a limited ability to deal with unexpected situations. If a novel or complicated situation arises, the pilot has to roll against a threshold (based on the situation's complexity) to see if it continues with its task, stops, or asks for new instructions.

#### **Autosofts:**

- **Function:** Autosofts are specialized programs that enhance a drone's performance. These can be considered the drone’s "skills." They are rated from 1 to 6 and can be swapped out with a Complex Matrix Action. A drone has a number of available autosoft slots equal to half its Device Rating, rounded up.
- **Types of Autosofts:**
    - **Clearsight:** Acts as the drone’s Perception skill.
    - **Electronic Warfare:** Functions like the Electronic Warfare skill.
    - **[Model] Evasion:** Helps drones avoid being locked on by sensors.
    - **[Model] Maneuvering:** Acts like a Pilot skill for a specific drone model.
    - **Stealth:** Used for infiltration, allowing drones to operate stealthily.
    - **Targeting:** Helps with Gunnery skill for a specific weapon model.
    - Drones can also run programs via an RCC (Remote Control Console) when slaved, allowing them to bypass their own program limits.

#### **Rigger Cyberprograms:**

- Riggers can also use programs that deckers use, but the programs must be purchased for the RCC, and cannot be swapped between an RCC and a cyberdeck.
- **Common Programs for Riggers:**
    - **Encryption:** Increases Firewall.
    - **Signal Scrub:** Reduces Noise.
    - **Toolbox:** Boosts Data Processing.
    - **Biofeedback Filter:** Reduces biofeedback damage.
    - **Guard:** Reduces extra damage from marks.
    - **Armor:** Adds protection against Matrix damage.
    - **Sneak:** Helps defend against Trace User actions.

#### **Drone Combat:**

- **Combat:** Drone combat is the same as regular character combat. Drones use the Gunnery skill for weapon attacks, and they use their Sensors for targeting. Specific combat rules for drones can be found in the Combat chapter of the book.

#### **Drone Perception and Infiltration:**

- **Perception:** When a drone is operating autonomously, it rolls a Pilot + Clearsight [Sensor] Test to observe its surroundings. If the rigger is jumped in, the rigger makes a Perception + Intuition [Sensor] Test using the drone's sensors.
- **Infiltration:** If a drone is attempting to be sneaky, it uses a Stealth + Intuition [Handling] Test (when jumped in) or Pilot + Stealth [Handling] (when not jumped in) to avoid detection. The drone might also need to enter "silent running mode" to avoid being detected in the Matrix.

#### **Drone Initiative:**

- **Autonomous Drones:** A drone acting on its own rolls Initiative with a score of Pilot Rating x 2, plus 3d6.
- **Jumped-In Drones:** If a rigger is jumped in, the drone uses the rigger’s VR Initiative instead of its own.

#### **Repairing Drones:**

- Drones have two damage tracks: **Physical** and **Matrix**. When either damage track fills up, the drone is destroyed or bricked. Repairing drones follows the standard rules for physical and Matrix damage repair, though fixing a damaged drone can be more expensive than replacing it.

#### **Example:**

- The example in the provided text follows a rigger named _Driver_ who is controlling a fleet of drones and vehicles remotely. Driver uses his Maersk Spider RCC to control several drones, running autosofts like Biofeedback Filter and Signal Scrub. His enemy, a decker named _Spike_, attempts to hack into Driver's drones, leading to a tense Matrix battle with both sides marking and countering each other's devices. Eventually, Driver uses his drones to fight back and outsmart Spike.
