The rules for riggers in _Shadowrun_ outline a unique type of character that can control vehicles, drones, and other devices using a combination of advanced technology and brain-machine interfaces. Here’s an overview of the key concepts:

### **Rigger Basics:**

- **Control Rig:** This implanted augmentation connects to various parts of the brain to control vehicles and drones as if they were an extension of the body. It enables precise control over movement, sensing, and even feeling damage, similar to how the body senses pain.
- **Rigger Interface:** A specialized interface that allows vehicles, drones, and devices to be controlled by the rigger. Most vehicles need this interface installed, while drones are typically built with it.

### **Rigging Actions:**

- **Jumping In:** The rigger can "jump" into a vehicle, drone, or other device by taking a Complex or Simple Action, depending on whether they are in AR or VR. When jumped in, the rigger’s mind merges with the device, controlling it as if it were their own body.
- **Control Methods:** There are four control methods:
    - **Manual:** Physical control like a steering wheel or throttle.
    - **Remote:** Control via remote device (e.g., commlink).
    - **Rigger Control:** Direct control through a control rig.
    - **Autopilot:** Pre-programmed control by the device itself.
- **Control Override:** Higher control methods can override lower ones. For example, rigger control can override manual or remote control.

### **Control Rig Features:**

- **Increased Limits:** When controlling a vehicle or drone, the limits of that device (such as Speed, Handling, and Sensor) are increased by the rating of the control rig.
- **Biofeedback Damage:** If a vehicle or device takes physical damage, the rigger experiences biofeedback, suffering damage that mirrors the pain of the vehicle.

### **RCC (Rigger Command Console):**

- **Purpose:** The RCC is like a deck for controlling drones and devices, allowing the rigger to manage multiple devices at once. It creates a Personal Area Network (PAN) of the devices controlled.
- **Features:** The RCC provides Noise Reduction and Sharing ratings, allowing for multiple devices to operate simultaneously. It also has Data Processing and Firewall ratings for managing and defending the network.

### **Rigger Skills:**

- Riggers rely on **Vehicle Active Skills** (such as **Pilot Ground Craft** and **Pilot Drone**) to control their devices. They also use **Gunnery** to shoot from vehicles or drones.

### **Rigging in Combat:**

- Riggers excel in combat by deploying combat drones or controlling a vehicle in a fight. They can provide fire support with drones or use vehicles to act like mobile strike forces or tanks.
- **Recon and Surveillance:** Riggers can use drones for reconnaissance, placing them in strategic positions for information gathering or monitoring.

### **VR and Noise:**

- **VR Mode:** When a rigger is jumped in, they operate in VR. They gain bonuses to Matrix actions (such as Vehicle Control and Gunnery) but may suffer biofeedback damage in hot-sim mode.
- **Noise and Jamming:** Rigging through wireless devices suffers from Noise penalties. Riggers can use Electronic Warfare to reduce noise or employ jamming to disrupt enemies.

### **Riggers and Deckers:**

- Riggers are vulnerable to hackers (deckers) trying to break into their systems. While deckers focus on the Matrix, riggers are powerful in controlling physical devices. However, hackers can potentially take control of a rigger's devices.

### **Command Console Table:**

- The RCC comes in various models with different ratings for **Data Processing**, **Firewall**, and **Noise Reduction**, allowing riggers to choose the console that best fits their needs.

### **Electronic Warfare for Riggers:**

- Riggers can use **Electronic Warfare** to reduce Noise, protect their devices from interference, or use jamming to disrupt enemies, especially in electronic duels.

In summary, riggers are tech-savvy individuals who control physical devices with their minds, making them powerful in both combat and reconnaissance. Their control over vehicles and drones gives them a unique role in both the physical and virtual worlds, though they must be careful of electronic threats like hackers.
