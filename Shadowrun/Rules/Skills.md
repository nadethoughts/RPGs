# Skills
## Skill groups
these are groups of skills that accomplish a category of activities. You can buy full skill groups for less karma than buying each skill individually, but more Karma than buying 1 of the skills in the group. You cannot have a specialization of a skill group.
## Specialization
Character can pick up a specialization to a skill, when they roll the skill and the specialisation is relavent, they get **+2 dice to their roll**.
## Defaulting
When character doesn't have a skill, but they are able to do the task (something that a reasonable person could do), they are able to just roll their **Attribute -1 die** to perform the task
### Substituting Skills
If you don't have the skill, but have a skill that could be used to perform the task, then ***you can substitute that skill with a GM imposed penalty*** (-3 dice for using Artisan in place of the disguise skill)
