This text provides comprehensive guidelines on **Enchanting** and **Alchemy** in Shadowrun, particularly regarding the crafting of magical items, alchemical preparations, and their interactions with the game mechanics. Below is a concise breakdown of the content:

### **ENCHANTING**

**Enchanting** allows magicians to manipulate natural elements and imbue objects with magic. This skill encompasses:

- **Creating Magical Foci:** Powerful, reusable items tied to their owners.
- **Breaking Down Magical Items:** Recovering magical reagents from dismantled items.

### **ALCHEMY**

Alchemy enables magicians to prepare objects to release spells under specific conditions. Preparations are less powerful than directly cast spells but offer flexibility and versatility.

#### **Steps to Create an Alchemical Preparation**

1. **Choose a Spell:** Select an alchemical version of a known spell.
2. **Choose Spell Force:** Decide the preparation's power level, limited by Magic Rating (up to Magic x2).
3. **Select the Lynchpin:** Pick a small, non-living object as the preparation's anchor.
4. **Set a Trigger:** Define when the preparation activates:
    - **Command (+2 Drain):** Magician-controlled activation.
    - **Contact (+1 Drain):** Activated upon touch.
    - **Time (+2 Drain):** Activated after a set period.
5. **Craft the Preparation:** Spend time crafting the lynchpin (minutes = Force). Then, roll **Alchemy + Magic [Force]** opposed by the preparation's Force. The resulting Potency determines strength and duration.
6. **Resist Drain:** Handle the spell's Drain, modified by the trigger.

#### **Using Preparations**

- Activated spells use Potency as the Spellcasting pool and Force as the Magic value.
- Sustained spells last Potency minutes, or until permanent for permanent spells.

### **ARTIFICING**

Artificing involves creating permanent magical foci through a multi-step process:

1. **Focus Formula:** Acquire or design an arcane recipe.
2. **Telesma:** Obtain or craft an object matching the formula.
3. **Magical Lodge:** Prepare a lodge with Force equal to or greater than the focus's Force.
4. **Spend Reagents:** Invest reagents equal to the karma required for bonding the focus.
5. **Craft the Focus:** Enchant the telesma over days equal to the Force, then make an **Artificing + Magic [Formula Force]** test opposed by **Force + Object Resistance**.
6. **Resist Drain:** Handle Drain based on Force and opposing test hits. If successful, spend Karma to complete the process.

### **DISENCHANTING**

Disenchanting allows magicians to:

- **Deactivate Foci:** Temporarily turn off magical effects.
- **Recycle Mana:** Convert destroyed foci into reagents.
- **Disjoin Preparations:** Remove magic from alchemical preparations.

#### Risks of Disenchanting

- Attempting to disjoin powerful preparations might trigger unintended effects, especially if the preparation uses a contact trigger.

### **Example**

Abbi Kadabra creates a **Force 5 Shadow spell preparation**:

- **Trigger:** Command (+2 Drain).
- **Crafting:** Spends 5 minutes etching a glass sphere, using 8 reagents to increase the Potency limit.
- **Rolls:** Alchemy + Magic (10 dice) vs. Force 5 (5 dice). Abbi scores 6 Potency.
- **Drain:** Resists physical Drain equal to 5 (Force - 2 + 2 for trigger).

The result is a potent alchemical tool for her job.
