This section of the _Shadowrun 5e_ rules provides detailed mechanics for the _Conjuring_ skill, including how to summon, bind, and banish spirits, as well as the relationship between spirits and their summoners. Here's a summary of key points:

### Conjuring Overview

- **Summoning**: The act of calling a spirit to serve the magician. Spirits are summoned with a Complex Action, and the spirit must make an opposed test to determine if it shows up. The number of services a spirit owes the summoner is equal to the number of net hits on the test. The spirit returns to its plane when the sun rises or sets, or once it has completed its services. The summoner also needs to resist Drain.
    
- **Binding**: Once a spirit is summoned, the magician can bind it to long-term service. This involves a Binding Test and can take an hour per point of Force. Binding spirits allows for continuous services, unlike summoned spirits, which vanish after their services are complete.
    
- **Banishing**: Banishing severs the connection between the spirit and the summoner. It involves a Complex Action and an opposed test. If the summoner wins, the spirit is freed and departs.
    

### Spirits and Services

- **Unbound Spirits**: When a spirit is unbound, it can offer services like combat assistance, power use, physical tasks, and remote services. Once an unbound spirit completes a remote task, it returns to its metaplane.
    
- **Bound Spirits**: Bound spirits are more powerful, offering the same services as unbound spirits, plus additional services like aiding in Alchemy or Spellcasting, spell sustaining, or spell binding. The latter involves the spirit sustaining a spell indefinitely but at the cost of its own Force.
    

### Spirit Types and Optional Powers

Spirits are categorized into different types (e.g., Air, Beasts, Earth, Fire) and each has unique abilities. For example:

- **Air Spirits** can use powers like _Accident_, _Concealment_, and _Sapience_.
- **Fire Spirits** are stronger in combat and can use _Elemental Attack_ and _Energy Aura_. Each spirit type can have optional powers based on its Force.

### Spirit-Summoner Relationship

- **Spiritual Bond**: A summoner can communicate telepathically with their summoned spirits. Spirits are aware when they are disrupted and the summoner knows when a spirit has been freed or destroyed.
    
- **Spirit Behavior**: Bound spirits can struggle against their servitude, especially if treated cruelly. If a spirit is forced to do unpleasant tasks, it may impose penalties on its own performance. A magician can attempt to calm a struggling spirit with a Summoning + Magic Test.
    

### Additional Mechanics

- **Spirit Range**: Spirits can only operate within a range equal to the magician's Magic rating times 100 meters. If they move beyond this range, they are considered on a "remote service."

This system offers flexibility in how spirits can be summoned, bound, and utilized, but also comes with the risk of alienating or angering spirits through misuse or cruelty. Balancing the benefits of powerful spirit allies with the ethical and practical limitations of using them is a core element of spirit magic in _Shadowrun_.
