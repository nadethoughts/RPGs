This section of _Shadowrun 5e_ provides a detailed overview of the Ritual Spellcasting system. Rituals are a slower, more complex form of spellcasting that allow magicians to achieve powerful magical effects that normal spells can't accomplish. The process is outlined in steps that require a lot of preparation and coordination, especially if performed by a group.

### Ritual Spellcasting Process Overview:

1. **Choose Ritual Leader**: One person, who must know the ritual, leads the group. Non-leaders can participate, but if they are not of the same tradition as the leader, they suffer a penalty.
2. **Choose Ritual**: The leader selects the ritual they want to perform, which may also require a spell (known to the leader) as part of the ritual.
3. **Choose Ritual Force**: The leader determines the ritual's Force, which impacts the ritual's power and any spells involved.
4. **Set Up the Foundation**: The ritual requires a magical lodge appropriate for the leader’s tradition. The Force of the lodge must meet or exceed the ritual's Force. Once active, no participant can leave the foundation until the ritual is completed.
5. **Give the Offering**: The leader expends reagents equal to the ritual's Force. Spending more reagents can reduce Drain when sealing the ritual later.
6. **Perform the Ritual**: This step involves performing the ritual itself. The duration is typically based on the ritual's Force.
7. **Seal the Ritual**: The leader makes a Ritual Spellcasting + Magic [Force] test against a target value. The results determine the outcome, with participants suffering Drain based on the number of hits.

### Ritual Failure & Glitches:

- **Failure**: A ritual fails if participants leave the foundation prematurely, the leader is incapacitated, or the foundation is disrupted. If it fails, all participants take Drain damage based on the Force of the ritual.
- **Glitches**: Can cause additional Drain, make the ritual harder to complete, or even have catastrophic effects, depending on the nature of the glitch.

### Types of Rituals:

- **Anchored Rituals**: Requires an anchor or physical object to focus the ritual. If moved, the ritual fails.
- **Material Link Rituals**: Use a material link (such as a tissue sample) to target the ritual at a distant subject.
- **Minion Rituals**: Create entities like watchers or homunculi to assist the leader. These minions are bound to the leader and can perform tasks.
- **Spell Rituals**: Enhance a spell’s effect or casting range (e.g., Prodigal Spell for distant combat spells).
- **Spotter Rituals**: If the target is out of sight, a participant must act as a spotter, providing the necessary link for the ritual to function.

### Examples of Rituals:

- **Curse**: Uses a material link to cast an illusion spell on a target, even without visual contact.
- **Prodigal Spell**: Allows a Combat spell to be cast at a target out of line of sight.
- **Remote Sensing**: Casts a detection spell with an expanded range, allowing multiple participants to share the perception.
- **Ward**: Creates an astral barrier with a Force equal to the ritual’s Force.

The learning process for rituals involves studying spell formulas or finding a mentor. The time required to learn a ritual is determined by the test results, and success involves spending Karma to finalize the learning.
