Initiation is a critical part of an Awakened character's progression in **Shadowrun 5e**, offering both mechanical benefits and narrative depth. Here's a quick summary and breakdown for easier reference:

---

### **What is Initiation?**

Initiation is a magical process through which Awakened characters deepen their understanding of magic and the astral plane. It provides access to metamagics, raises the natural cap on the **Magic** attribute, and enhances magical abilities.

---

### **Requirements to Initiate**

- **Awakened:** Only characters with a **Magic** attribute can initiate.
- **Preparation:** Initiation involves extensive preparation through study, rituals, or spiritual journeys, based on tradition.
- **Time:** It requires an **Arcana + Intuition [Astral] (initiate grade, 1 month)** Extended Test.

---

### **Benefits of Initiation**

1. **Increased Magic Cap**
    - Natural maximum for **Magic** becomes **6 + initiate grade**.
    - Requires spending Karma to increase **Magic** normally.
2. **Metaplanar Access**
    - After first initiation, the character gains the ability to travel to metaplanes (if they can astrally project).
3. **Metamagics**
    - Each initiation grade grants one metamagic (see detailed options below).

---

### **Costs**

- **Karma:** 10+(Grade×3)10 + (Grade \times 3) Karma per grade.
- **Limit:** Initiate grade cannot exceed the character's current **Magic** rating. If **Magic** is reduced below the initiate grade, the grade decreases.

---

### **Metamagics**

#### General Metamagics

- **Centering:** Adds initiate grade to **Drain Resistance Tests** by performing a centering action. Free action during casting.
- **Flexible Signature:** Alters astral signature to disguise, forge, or reduce its duration. Useful for subterfuge.
- **Masking:** Masks aura or astral form. Can disguise Magic Rating, appear mundane, or look like another type (e.g., a spirit). Opposed by **Magic + initiate grade**.
- **Quickening:** Permanently sustain a spell by spending Karma (up to the spell's Force). Grants bonus dice vs. dispelling equal to Karma spent.
- **Spell Shaping:** Adjust area spells’ radius or create unaffected "bubbles" within the spell area. Imposes dice penalties for flexibility.
- **Shielding:** Adds initiate grade to spell defense dice pools.

#### Adept-Specific Metamagics

- **Adept Centering:** Reduces negative modifiers for **Physical** and **Combat** skills by initiate grade with a focusing action.
- **Power Point:** Grants an additional power point instead of a metamagic. Can be chosen repeatedly.

---

### **Magical Goods and Costs**

- **Foci:**  
    Example: Power Focus costs **Force × 18,000¥**, availability **Force × 4R**.
- **Magical Lodge Materials:** **Force × 500¥.**
- **Reagents:** **20¥ per dram.**
