### **General Rules for Foci**

1. **Physical Form**:
    - Foci can take many forms, often reflecting the tradition of their creator: amulets, wands, staves, tattoos, daggers, etc.
2. **Force Rating**:
    - Determines the focus's power and its effects.
3. **Bonding**:
    - **Prerequisites**: Only **Awakened** individuals can bond foci.
    - **Process**: Requires an hour per point of Force and Karma equal to the focus's Bonding Cost.
    - Bonding synchronizes the focus’s astral signature with the magician’s and breaks any previous bonds.
4. **Activation**:
    - Activating a focus is a **Simple Action**.
    - It must be in your possession (carried, worn, or held) to remain active.
    - Foci deactivate automatically if you lose consciousness or possession.
5. **Usage Limits**:
    - **Maximum Number**: Limited to your **Magic attribute**.
    - **Maximum Force**: Total Force of bonded foci cannot exceed **Magic × 5**.
    - Only one focus can add its Force to any given test.
6. **Astral Interactions**:
    - Active foci have an astral form and are visible on the astral plane.
    - While projecting astrally, you carry the astral forms of your active foci.
