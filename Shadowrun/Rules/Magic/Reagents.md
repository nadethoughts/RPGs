       - Use drams to set a new limit for Counterspelling instead of using the Astral limit.

### **Steps to Harvest Reagents**

1. **Choose the Right Location**:
    - Working in an environment aligned with your magical tradition makes harvesting easier. For example:
        - **Shamans** might prefer forests or natural settings.
        - **Hermetic magicians** might work best in areas rich with minerals or ancient ruins.
    - It’s not mandatory to be in a tradition-suited environment, but it significantly impacts yield.
2. **Activate Astral Perception**:
    - You must be **astrally perceiving** to observe the flow of mana while interacting with the physical world.
3. **Spend Time Searching**:
    - Dedicate **one full hour** to searching for reagents in the chosen area.
4. **Make the Test**:
    - Roll **Alchemy + Magic [Mental]**.
    - **Results**:
        - In a tradition-suited area: Gain **1 dram per 2 hits**.
        - In an unsuitable area: Gain **1 dram per 4 hits**.

### **Special Circumstances**

- **Unique Opportunities**:
    - Harvesting from rare events (e.g., a dragon’s remains or a magically infused battlefield) follows the same rules:
        - Spend an hour and roll **Alchemy + Magic [Mental]**.
        - The yield depends on hits, just like normal harvesting.
    - Be prepared for environmental or scenario-specific modifiers imposed by the GM.

---

### **Sustainability and Resource Management**

- **Area Depletion**:
    - Each harvested dram exhausts the **hectare-sized area** for future reagent gathering.
    - Recovery rate: **Two days per dram** of reagents harvested.
    - This can cause conflicts among magicians and talismongers competing for limited resources.

---

### **Buying Reagents**

- Cost: **20 nuyen per dram** from a talismonger.
- Buying reagents is convenient but more expensive than gathering them yourself.

---

### **Strategy and Tips**

- **Know Your Tradition’s Hotspots**:
    - Scout areas aligned with your tradition to maximize harvest efficiency.
    - Protect key resource areas from competitors or hostile forces.
- **Time Your Efforts**:
    - Harvest during downtime or after missions in potent areas.
    - Avoid areas recently tapped by others unless desperate.
- **Plan for Conflict**:
    - In resource-rich areas, expect competition from rival magicians or talismonger groups.
    - Work discreetly or negotiate resource-sharing agreements.
- **Diversify Your Sources**:
    - Balance self-harvesting with purchasing reagents to ensure a steady supply for rituals, spells, and emergencies.
