- **Nature**: A photonegative and emotionally charged reflection of the physical world.
- **Visibility**: Only living things and mana-infused objects are solid and tangible; physical objects appear as intangible shadows.
- **Mana**: The life force driving magic, flowing from the metaplanes to the physical world via the astral plane.
- **Echoes**: Emotional imprints on objects and locations appear as more vibrant or tangible "shadows" based on their significance.

---

### **Auras and Astral Forms**

- **Auras**: Shining, colorful luminescence cast by living things on the astral plane.
- **Astral Forms**: Tangible manifestations of entities active in the astral plane (e.g., spirits, foci, dual-natured beings).
- **Earth's Form**: The planet has an astral form, supporting the idea of it being a living entity.

---

### **Astral Signature**

- **Definition**: The magical "fingerprint" left by spells, rituals, or magical effects.
- **Duration**: Remains for a number of hours equal to the effect's Force, then fades into the background.
- **Detection**: Magicians can read astral signatures with an Assensing + Intuition [Astral] test.
- **Erasure**: Magicians can accelerate the fading of their astral signatures to avoid detection.

---

### **Astral Perception**

- **Who Can Use It**: Magicians and Adepts with the Astral Perception power.
- **Function**: Allows observation of the astral plane overlaid on the material world.
- **Dual-Natured**: Astrally perceiving beings are active in both planes, which can be distracting (-2 dice to physical tasks).
- **Assensing**: The skill to interpret auras and gain insights about their emotional or physical state.

---

### **Astral Projection**

- **Exclusive to Magicians**: Allows them to separate their consciousness and explore the astral plane.
- **Movement**: Astral forms move at near-thought speed but are blocked by astral barriers or underground spaces.
- **Interaction**: Astral forms can engage with astral objects or other astral forms but cannot directly influence the physical plane.
- **Time Limit**: Magicians can project for a number of hours equal to their Magic Rating x 2 before their astral form dissipates, leading to death.

---

### **Manifesting**

- **Definition**: Astral forms appearing as ghostly, hazy images visible on the physical plane.
- **Interaction**: Allows communication but not physical interaction. No spells can be cast, and technology cannot detect the manifestation.

---

### **Astral Detection**

- **Physical Awareness**: Living beings may sense passing astral forms as a chill or tingling sensation with a Perception + Intuition test.
- **Numinous Perception**: A specialization in perceiving magical or astral phenomena.

---

### **Practical Applications**

- **Security Implications**: The presence of astral intruders can alert guards and security personnel.
- **Magical Forensics**: Astral signatures can be analyzed to identify the source of magical activities.
- **Stealth Considerations**: Magicians must manage their astral signatures and movements carefully during covert operations.
This text elaborates on the mechanics of **astral combat**, **astral tracking**, and **mana barriers** in **Shadowrun**. Here's a summary and breakdown of the information:

---

### **Astral Combat**

- **Mechanics**:
    - Resolves similarly to physical combat but with specialized attributes and skills.
    - Dual-natured or astrally perceiving characters use **physical attributes**.
    - Astrally projecting characters use **mental attributes** from the Astral Attributes Table:
        - **Intuition** for Reaction
        - **Logic** for Agility
        - **Willpower** for Strength
        - **Charisma** for Body
- **Attack Options**:
    - **Unarmed Combat**:
        - Test: _Astral Combat + Willpower [Astral]_ vs. _Intuition + Logic._
        - Damage: **Charisma** as base DV, plus net hits.
    - **Weapon Focus**:
        - Test: _Astral Combat + Willpower [Accuracy]_ vs. _Intuition + Logic._
        - Damage: Based on the weapon's stats, using **Charisma** instead of Strength for base damage.
    - Damage Type: Either **Stun** or **Physical**, chosen by the attacker. **Astral barriers** only take Physical damage.
- **No Ranged Combat**: Only unarmed attacks, weapon foci, and mana spells work in astral space.

---

### **Astral Tracking**

- **Definition**: Awakened entities can follow astral links between magical effects (e.g., spells, spirits, projecting magicians, foci) and their sources.
- **Mechanics**:
    - Test: _Assensing + Intuition (5, 1 hour) [Astral]_ Extended Test.
    - Modifiers:
        - Each hour since the astral link was active: +1 Threshold.
        - Target behind a mana barrier: Add the Force of the barrier to the Threshold.
        - Tracking a master via a spirit:
            - **Bound spirit**: No modifier.
            - **Unbound spirit**: +2 Threshold.
- **Application**: Useful for tracking down magicians or sources of magical activity.

---

### **Mana Barriers**

- **Purpose**: Block or impede magical effects, astral forms, and movement.
- **Types**:
    - **Physical Plane Mana Barriers**:
        - Invisible (to normal perception) but act as solid barriers to spells, spirits, manifesting entities, and active foci.
        - Casting a spell through the barrier adds the Force of the barrier to the defense or resistance dice pool.
        - Non-opposed spells: Spellcasting becomes an Opposed Test against the Force of the barrier.
    - **Astral Plane Mana Barriers**:
        - Appear as hazy, opaque walls.
        - Stop astral movement and impose a visual penalty equal to their Force.
        - Block astral forms and resist astral spells.
    - **Dual-Natured Mana Barriers**:
        - Active on both planes simultaneously, combining the effects of physical and astral barriers.
- **Creation**: Refer to the following sources:
    - **Circle of Protection Ritual** (Both planes): p. 298.
    - **Magical Lodge** (Both planes): p. 280.
    - **Mana Barrier Spell** (Either plane): p. 294.
    - **Ward Ritual** (Both planes): p. 297.
- **Innate Effects**:
    - Certain adept and critter powers bypass mana barriers, as they are considered intrinsic and not subject to disruption.

### **Astral Damage Table**

|**Attack Type**|**Test**|**Damage**|
|---|---|---|
|Unarmed|_Astral Combat + Willpower [Astral]_ vs. _Intuition + Logic_|**Charisma** as base DV|
|Weapon Focus|_Astral Combat + Willpower [Accuracy]_ vs. _Intuition + Logic_|Weapon DV using **Charisma** instead of Strength|
|Spirit|N/A|**Force**|
|Watcher|N/A|1|
### **Getting Past Mana Barriers**

Mana barriers can be obstacles on the physical and astral planes, but there are options for bypassing them:

#### **Option 1: Break Through Violently**

- **Combat Approach**:
    - Treat the mana barrier as having **Armor** and **Structure** equal to its **Force**.
    - Attack the barrier as if it were a physical object.
    - Barriers regain full **Structure** at the end of every **Combat Turn**.
    - The creator is **instantly aware** of any attack on the barrier.

#### **Option 2: Pass Through Subtly**

- **Press Through Test**:
    - Roll: _Magic + Charisma [Astral]_ vs. _Force x 2_ (Opposed Test).
    - **Success**:
        - Any **net hits** allow you to pass through the barrier.
        - You can bring along a number of entities (friends, spirits, active foci, sustained spells, etc.) equal to your net hits.
    - **Failure**:
        - If the barrier scores more hits, you fail and cannot pass through.

---

### **Astral Intersections**

Astral forms and mana barriers often interact with physical objects. When such intersections occur, the consequences can be significant:

#### **Mechanics**:

1. **Opposed Test**:
    - **Living Beings**: _Magic + Charisma_.
    - **Non-Living Objects/Barriers**: _Force x 2_.
2. **Outcomes**:
    - **Net Hits**: The entity with net hits remains unaffected.
    - **Tie**: All entities involved are disrupted.

#### **Disruption Effects**:

- **Living Beings**:
    - Knocked **unconscious** with a full **Stun Condition Monitor**.
- **Spells and Rituals**:
    - Immediately **end**.
- **Preparations**:
    - Lose their magic and become **mundane**.
- **Mana Barriers**:
    - **Collapse** (but permanent barriers regain full **Structure** at the end of the **Combat Turn**).
- **Foci**:
    - Become **deactivated**.
- **Spirits**:
    - Are **banished**.

---

### **Examples of Astral Intersections**:

- A **vehicle with a mana barrier** drives into a **warded area**.
- An **astrally perceiving magician** enters a **warded space** via elevator.
- A **spell focus** amulet is placed inside a **spirit focus** box.

In these cases, each entity involved must resolve the Opposed Test to determine the outcome.

---

### **Strategic Considerations**

- **Subtle Passage**: Attempting to press through is less destructive and avoids alerting the barrier's creator, but requires strong dice pools in _Magic + Charisma_.
- **Violent Destruction**: Effective against low-Force barriers but will always notify the creator.
- **Timing**: If you must attack, aim to overwhelm the barrier in a single turn to avoid it regenerating.
- **Coordination**: In astral intersections, plan movement carefully to minimize disruptions to critical assets like spells or spirits.
