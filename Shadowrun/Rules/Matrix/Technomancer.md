Technomancers in _Shadowrun_ are metahumans who have an uncanny, almost mystical ability to interact with the Matrix. They don’t require the usual technology or devices to access and manipulate data streams; their connection to the Matrix is instinctual, which makes them both fascinating and dangerous to others. Unlike deckers who rely on equipment, technomancers directly interface with the Matrix through their own cognitive and Resonance abilities.

Here are some key aspects of technomancers:

1. **The Matrix and Technomancers:**
    
    - To technomancers, the Matrix is their native environment, and they instinctively interact with it. They can perceive the Matrix as a natural part of their world, much like walking is for non-technomancers. This ability makes them incredibly fast and efficient in manipulating data.
2. **Resonance:**
    
    - This is the energy that technomancers tap into within the Matrix, which allows them to manipulate data, interact with devices, and summon sprites. Their Resonance attribute affects their Resonance-based abilities and their persona in the Matrix. When their Resonance reaches zero (often due to the loss of Essence), they lose their Technomancer quality.
3. **Resonance Signatures:**
    
    - Every time a technomancer uses their Resonance abilities, they leave a unique signature in the Matrix. Other Resonance beings, such as other technomancers or sprites, can detect these signatures through a Matrix Perception test. These signatures can be erased with the appropriate action.
4. **Resonance Actions:**
    
    - Technomancers can perform special actions that don’t require marks on a target, which sets them apart from other Matrix users like deckers. These actions generally involve manipulating data, summoning and controlling sprites, or even threading complex forms (programs or abilities) in the Matrix. However, using these powers comes with a mental drain called **Fading**.
5. **Living Persona:**
    
    - Unlike deckers who use a cyberdeck or commlink, technomancers have a "living persona" in the Matrix, which is their direct, self-generated interface. Their living persona’s attributes are based on their Resonance rating and mental attributes. Technomancers also have a special ability to naturally function in hot-sim VR, giving them a +2 bonus to Matrix Perception tests. They don't have a separate Matrix Condition Monitor; instead, Matrix damage hits them directly as Stun damage.
6. **Threading Complex Forms:**
    
    - Threading allows technomancers to shape the Matrix with their mental abilities, creating complex forms that produce specific effects. These forms can be anything from boosting a device’s attributes to altering a file. The higher the level of the complex form, the stronger the effect, but also the more risky it is for the technomancer. Threading causes Fading damage based on the results of the action.
7. **Sprites:**
    
    - Sprites are digital creatures that technomancers can summon to assist them. These can be used for various tasks like gathering information or performing Matrix actions. Technomancers can also compile, decompile, or register sprites with the appropriate Resonance actions.
8. **Fading and Mental Strain:**
    
    - All Resonance abilities cause Fading, a form of mental exhaustion that is resisted by the technomancer’s Resonance and Willpower. The more powerful the Resonance action, the more likely the technomancer will suffer Fading. This can result in Stun or Physical damage depending on the situation.
9. **Resonance Library:**
    
    - Technomancers share complex forms in the Resonance Library. These forms are essentially pre-designed Matrix actions that technomancers can learn and use. Learning new complex forms requires a test and spending Karma, and each technomancer can only learn a number based on their Resonance rating.
10. **Using Mundane Electronics:**
    
    - Although technomancers can use standard equipment like a commlink or cyberdeck, they lose the ability to use their Resonance powers while doing so. Their abilities only work through their living persona, which can't be used simultaneously with regular tech devices.

In conclusion, technomancers are powerful, unique individuals with an unparalleled connection to the Matrix. They can manipulate data with ease and control the flow of information, but they must deal with the constant risk of Fading and the distrust others have for their abilities. Their relationship with the Matrix is far deeper than that of other users, making them both indispensable and potentially dangerous allies—or enemies—in the world of _Shadowrun_.
