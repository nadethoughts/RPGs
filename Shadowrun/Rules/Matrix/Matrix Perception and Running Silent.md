The Matrix is an endless sea of icons, representing everything from devices to personas. To interact with an icon, you must first **spot** it using Matrix Perception. Here's how it works:

---

### **Spotting Icons**

#### **Automatic Spotting**

- **Proximity**: You can automatically spot icons of devices **not running silent** within **100 meters** of your physical location. This applies regardless of your Matrix location, as it relies on your commlink, deck, or living persona's antenna.
- **Hosts**: Hosts can always be spotted from anywhere on the planet, provided they aren’t running silent.

#### **Matrix Perception Test**

If an icon is farther than 100 meters or running silent, you'll need a **Matrix Perception Test**:

- **Test**: **Computer + Intuition [Data Processing]**
- **Purpose**: To locate a specific icon or gather information about icons within range.

#### **Marks**

- If you have a **mark** on an icon, you can spot it automatically, regardless of distance or whether it’s running silent.

### **Spotting Silent Icons**

To find an icon that’s running silent, you must first confirm its presence and then identify it:

1. **Detecting Silent Icons**
    
    - Use a Matrix Perception Test to ask if any icons are running silent in your vicinity (within 100 meters or in the same host).
    - If successful, you’ll learn that there are silent icons nearby but not their exact location.
2. **Identifying a Silent Icon**
    
    - Perform an **Opposed Test**:  
        **Computer + Intuition [Data Processing]** vs. **Logic + Sleaze**.
    - **Outcome**:
        - **More Hits**: You spot the icon and can interact with it.
        - **Tie or Fewer Hits**: The icon remains hidden.
    - **Multiple Silent Icons**: If there are several silent icons, you must pick one randomly for this test.

#### **Losing an Icon**

- You stop spotting an icon if:
    - It uses the **Hide** action successfully against you.
    - It **reboots** or **jacks out**.

### **Matrix Perception Details**

Each hit on a **Matrix Perception Test** lets you learn one piece of information about an icon. Possible queries include:

- Spotting a specific icon.
- Checking the most recent edit date of a file.
- Determining the number of Matrix damage boxes on a target.
- Identifying the presence and rating of a **data bomb**.
- Listing programs being run by a persona.
- Revealing the **Device Rating** or a specific Matrix attribute.
- Determining if an icon is using a **non-standard look**.
- Discovering a file’s protection and its rating.
- Learning the grid used by a persona, device, or host.
- Checking for silent-running icons nearby.
- Determining the last Matrix action performed by an icon and when.

### **Running Silent**

#### **What It Does**

- Reduces traffic to and from the Matrix, making it harder for others to detect you.
- Applies a **–2 dice pool penalty** to all Matrix actions you perform due to the extra processing required.

#### **How to Switch**

- Switching to silent running is a **Simple Action**.

### **Detecting Hackers**

#### **Attack Actions**

- If you succeed: The target knows it’s under attack but doesn’t automatically spot you. It may search for you or alert its owner (or launch IC if it’s a host).
- If you fail: The target doesn’t notice the attempt but note that rejected code can cause damage to you.

#### **Sleaze Actions**

- If you succeed: Your presence remains undetected.
- If you fail: The target gets a **free mark** on you (or its owner does if the target is a device). This reveals you instantly and may trigger alerts or IC.

### **Practical Example: Silent Icon Spotting**

- A decker, **Ghost**, knows there’s a silent icon nearby because of a Matrix Perception Test. They:
    1. Roll an Opposed Test: **Computer + Intuition [Data Processing]** vs. the icon’s **Logic + Sleaze**.
    2. If successful, Ghost spots the icon and can begin interacting with it. If not, they must try again or gather more information.

Understanding how to effectively perceive and interact with the Matrix is essential for both offense and defense, ensuring you can locate targets while keeping your activities hidden.
