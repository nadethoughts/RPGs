In **Shadowrun**, personas can interact with the Matrix in one of three modes: **Augmented Reality (AR)**, **Cold-Sim Virtual Reality (VR)**, and **Hot-Sim Virtual Reality (VR)**. Each mode provides a different level of immersion and has distinct advantages, disadvantages, and risks.

### **Augmented Reality (AR)**

**Description**:

- AR is the most basic mode of interaction with the Matrix, where you are still fully aware of the physical world. You use AR to overlay virtual information on top of your real-world vision. For example, you can see device icons, security systems, or system information overlaid in your field of view.
- In AR, you can still interact with the Matrix, enter hosts, or use devices, but your **icon** (your representation in the Matrix) will appear slow and jerky compared to those using VR.

**Key Features**:

- **No biofeedback damage**: Since AR doesn’t involve total immersion, you don't take biofeedback damage.
- **Initiative**: You use your normal physical **Initiative** and **Initiative Dice**.
- **Perception penalty**: If you're really focused on your AR display, you might get a **–2 penalty** on **Perception tests** to notice things happening in the physical world.

### **Cold-Sim Virtual Reality (VR)**

**Description**:

- In **cold-sim VR**, your body relaxes, and you are no longer aware of your physical surroundings. Your mind is interfaced with the Matrix through **simsense filters**, which help protect you from dangerous signals, but it also introduces a delay in the feedback, making it slower than hot-sim VR.
- You see and experience the Matrix directly, as though you were really there, soaring among the various icons, hosts, and entities.

**Key Features**:

- **Initiative**: You use **Data Processing + Intuition** for your **Initiative**, and you get a bonus of **+3D6** **Initiative Dice** (max 5D6 total).
- **Biofeedback damage**: If you take biofeedback damage, it is **Stun damage**.
- **Slower Experience**: The process is slower than in hot-sim VR because the data is filtered, but your mind is still protected from being overwhelmed by sensory input.

### **Hot-Sim Virtual Reality (VR)**

**Description**:

- **Hot-sim VR** is the most immersive and dangerous mode. In hot-sim, you experience the Matrix with **no filters**, flooding your senses with full **simsense** input. It affects not only your sense of sight, sound, and touch, but also your emotions, making it the most intuitive and real connection to the Matrix.
- While hot-sim VR offers the best Matrix experience, it is also **highly addictive** and **risky**. The lack of filters makes it dangerous to your mind and body, as it is possible to become overwhelmed by the constant flood of sensory data.

**Key Features**:

- **Initiative**: You use **Data Processing + Intuition** for your **Initiative**, and you get a **+4D6** **Initiative Dice** bonus (max 5D6 total).
- **Matrix Actions**: In hot-sim, you receive a **+2 dice pool bonus** to all Matrix actions.
- **Biofeedback damage**: If you take biofeedback damage, it is **Physical damage** rather than Stun damage, making it more dangerous.
- **Addiction risk**: Hot-sim is highly addictive due to the intense, better-than-life sensory experience it provides. Prolonged exposure can lead to mental issues or full-blown addiction.

Each mode of interaction has its benefits and drawbacks, with **AR** being the most accessible and low-risk, while **cold-sim VR** offers a balanced level of immersion with some risk, and **hot-sim VR** is the most powerful but dangerous mode, often used by those who need to fully experience the Matrix or for those seeking an edge in hacking or operations within the virtual world.
