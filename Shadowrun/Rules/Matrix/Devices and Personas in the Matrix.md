The Matrix is populated by devices and personas, each with distinct roles and characteristics that shape how actions are performed and interactions take place.

### **Devices**

Devices are the physical, real-world objects connected to the Matrix. These are the icons you interact with in the Matrix that represent actual things in the physical world, such as vehicles, commlinks, drones, weapons, and even appliances. Essentially, if it has a microchip and is wireless, it's a device in the Matrix.

#### **Types of Devices**

Devices are categorized by their **Device Rating**, which ranges from 1 to 6. This rating represents how advanced and secure the device is in the Matrix.

- **Device Rating 1**: Simple devices like general appliances, public terminals, and entertainment systems.
- **Device Rating 2**: Average devices like personal electronics, basic cyberware, vehicles, drones, and residential security devices.
- **Device Rating 3**: Smart devices like security vehicles, high-end corporate devices, and some drones.
- **Device Rating 4**: Advanced devices like military security devices and high-end cyberware.
- **Device Rating 5**: Cutting-edge devices like betaware and black-ops vehicles.
- **Device Rating 6**: Bleeding-edge devices like experimental tech, spacecraft, or billion-nuyen devices.

#### **Matrix Attributes for Devices**

Devices have the following attributes in the Matrix:

- **Device Rating**: This represents the overall effectiveness and power of the device.
- **Data Processing**: Determines the device's ability to handle and process data.
- **Firewall**: Represents the security of the device.

#### **Matrix Spotting**

When you're trying to locate a device, you need to determine if it's running silently or not. The difficulty of detecting the device varies depending on its proximity and whether it’s running silently. Devices within **100 meters** can be spotted automatically if not running silently, or you need a **Computer + Intuition** (Data Processing) vs. **Logic + Sleaze** test if they are running silently. Devices outside 100 meters typically require a **Simple Computer + Intuition** check.

### **Personas**

Personas are the “people” in the Matrix. They represent the users (hackers, technomancers, agents) interacting with the Matrix, either through their devices or independently.

#### **User Personas**

- **Connected to Devices**: When a user connects to the Matrix, their device’s icon is subsumed into the persona’s icon. The device itself temporarily disappears from the Matrix while the persona is connected.
- **One Persona at a Time**: A user can only run one persona at a time. To switch personas (i.e., from one device to another), both the current device and the target device must be rebooted.

#### **Agent Personas**

Agents are automated programs that perform tasks on behalf of their owners. When an agent is running on a device, it takes over the device’s icon, much like a user persona would. If a user runs an agent alongside their own persona, the agent gets its own separate icon but still operates on the same device.

#### **IC (Intrusion Countermeasure) Personas**

IC programs are hostile entities within a host, and they each have their own persona. These are not tied to any physical device but exist within hosts to protect data and prevent unauthorized access.

#### **Technomancer Personas**

Technomancers are unique in that they have a living persona not attached to any specific device. This persona exists in the Matrix as long as the technomancer is awake and connected. When they compile a sprite (a type of virtual being), that sprite also has its own persona. Technomancers’ personas are particularly versatile because they aren't bound to physical devices.

### **Summary**

- **Devices**: Physical, real-world items with ratings, such as drones, vehicles, and appliances. They are the icons that represent tangible objects in the Matrix.
- **Personas**: The "people" of the Matrix, representing users (hackers, agents, technomancers). Personas interact directly with the Matrix and are associated with devices or existing independently, as in the case of technomancers.
