In Shadowrun 5e, **Hosts** are isolated virtual environments within the Matrix, designed to serve specific functions like business, social, or entertainment purposes. They can be compared to miniature versions of the Matrix, each hosting its own virtual space that’s distinct from the greater grid. Here’s a summary of key concepts related to Hosts in the Matrix:

1. **External and Internal Access**:
    
    - Hosts are accessed through the Matrix, often represented by a large icon that looks like a building or another physical space.
    - Once inside, you interact with icons within the host but are unable to interact with the broader Matrix outside of the host.
    - The external size of the host can be misleading, as the internal virtual space can range from the size of a house to a large city or metroplex.
2. **Host Rating and Attributes**:
    
    - A host’s **rating** determines its size, complexity, and overall strength. Ratings range from 1 (basic) to 12 (megacorp-level or military command).
    - Hosts have four **Matrix attributes**: Attack, Sleaze, Data Processing, and Firewall. These attributes determine the host’s security, speed, and resistance to intrusions.
3. **Intrusion Countermeasures (IC)**:
    
    - Hosts can deploy **IC** programs to protect themselves from hackers. IC operates as both an attack mechanism and a defense, working to disable or destroy intruders. IC is ruthless and efficient, often attacking immediately once an intrusion is detected.
    - Various types of IC include **Acid**, **Blaster**, **Black IC**, **Killer**, and more, each with different effects ranging from damaging programs and causing system crashes to biofeedback damage.
4. **Host Convergence and Security**:
    
    - Hosts do not have their own **Overwatch Score**, but once an intruder is detected, they are marked and subjected to IC deployment.
    - Once a persona reaches convergence (a high Overwatch Score), the host will add additional marks and deploy IC to deal with the intruder.
    - Most hosts don’t run IC all the time; instead, they often have **Patrol IC**, which scans for unauthorized actions but is not inherently hostile.
5. **File Archives and Data Access**:
    
    - Hosts have **archives** to store inactive files, which may require special access or manipulation to retrieve. These archives are typically inaccessible to the average hacker.
6. **Security Response**:
    
    - If a host detects an unauthorized user, it alerts its owner or designated security personnel and launches IC.
    - The host can launch one IC per Combat Turn and can run up to its rating in active IC at once.

**Example Hosts**:

- **Low-level Hosts (Rating 1-4)**: Personal sites, public libraries, small businesses, and local venues.
- **Mid-level Hosts (Rating 5-8)**: Matrix games, local corporations, universities, or police systems.
- **High-level Hosts (Rating 9-12)**: Secure corporate sites, government offices, and military or clandestine organizations.

**Intrusion Countermeasures (IC) Types**:

- **Acid IC**: Reduces Firewall and causes damage.
- **Blaster IC**: Deals damage with biofeedback and can lock the target.
- **Black IC**: Most dangerous, causing both Matrix and biofeedback damage, potentially lethal.
- **Patrol IC**: Constantly scans for intruders and gathers intelligence but doesn't attack.
- **Probe IC**: Marks intruders for tracking.
- **Track IC**: Links the intruder’s location to the real world, possibly alerting authorities.

These elements can add depth to a Shadowrun session by creating tension within the Matrix. Players, especially Decker or Technomancer characters, will need to navigate these environments carefully, balancing speed and caution to avoid triggering IC or being caught in a dangerous security response.
