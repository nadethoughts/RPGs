This text provides an in-depth overview of the rules and features surrounding programs in _Shadowrun 5th Edition_. Here's a summary of the key concepts:

### **Programs Overview**

- **Cyberprograms** enhance a decker's performance in the Matrix.
- Only one instance of a program type can run on a deck at a time.
- Programs have customizable icons tied to their functions (e.g., a "Hammer" might look like a hammer or a spiked bat).
- Programs stop providing benefits once they are deactivated or swapped.

### **Program Types**

1. **Common Programs**: Legal and widely available; they offer utility and quality-of-life improvements for Matrix activities.
2. **Hacking Programs**: Illegal and dangerous, enhancing a decker's offensive or defensive capabilities during Matrix runs.

### **Agents**

- Autonomous programs with ratings of 1â€“6.

- Run as their own persona (and icon), sharing the same Matrix Condition Monitor as their host device.
- Can perform Matrix actions independently.

### **Matrix Actions and Limits**

Matrix actions are grouped by their primary use (e.g., device manipulation, file manipulation) and by the limit they rely on:

- **Attack**: Actions like _Data Spike_, _Brute Force_, and _Crash Program_.
- **Sleaze**: Actions like _Hack on the Fly_, _Spoof Command_, and _Hide_.
- **Data Processing**: Includes _Edit File_, _Matrix Perception_, and _Trace Icon_.
- **Firewall**: Handles actions like _Disarm Data Bomb_ and _Jack Out_.

This structured approach allows players to effectively choose tools and strategies for Matrix runs, balancing offense, defense, and utility. Would you like help setting up a decker's program suite or designing a specific scenario?
