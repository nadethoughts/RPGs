# Chase of the Nimblewright

## Location: Waterdeep

## **Starting Location**
### On the Road to the City of the Dead.

# Preamble
* ***Everyone Starts with 1 point of inspiration***
 ## What happened last time? 
* The party went searching for the Nimblewright and through some solid investigation, using good tools and pure luck, they were able to find it and destroy it. 
* They found an address on it with a name Grinda Garloth. 
* When they made it to her house they found that there were a number of Xanathar Thugs on the outside trying to break their way in. 
* The team was able to defeat the attackers, and were able to get it done so efficiently that the escalation that was in progress deescalated very quickly. 
* Upon talking to Grinda they discovered that the Stone of Galorr was no longer there. That she had given it to her rat familiar to take it her familie's mosoleum in the city of the dead.

## Grinda's Rat to the Dead City

## Off to the **City of the Dead**
* ***Aric*** and *Leaf* **know** that the **City of the Dead** is Guarded. 
* On their way to the **City of the Dead** the Characters are followed by a *gazer* (for Xanathar to figure out where the stone is) 
    * *Stealth: **19** against Charactes Passive Perception to discover it*

## Mausoleum (Encounter 4)
* If caught the Players will be escorted out and the city guard will be informed
    * DC for getting around the Grave Yard will me much harder as the guards on on high alert

* The Door is unlocked

* The Mausoleum is already broken into with the [Stone of Galorr](Objects/stone-of-golorr.md) no where to be seen as well as the remains of [Grinda's](NPCs/grinda-garloth.md) ancestors.
* Upon Searching the Crypt, they do find a clue as to who the grave robbers are.
    * Characters who search the underground crypts can find a shiny steel key lying in the dust on the floor. One of the grave robbers dropped it while looting the crypts.
## (Towns and Taverns Book 2 Page 37)
* When leaving the crypt, the players are Jumped by 4 Duergar **Xanathar Guild Members**


## What about the Key?
* Some lock smith can identify the key as the handiwork of a dwarf locksmith in the Trades Ward named [Elaspra Ulmarr](../Waterdeep-Dragonheist/NPCs/elaspra-ulmarr.md). 
* From [Elaspra](NPCs/elaspra-ulmarr.md) or her records, the characters learn that she sold the key to a man named [Volkarr Kibbens](NPCs/volkarr-kibbens.md), whose address is an old windmill in the Southern Ward. The key unlocks the door to his apartment, which he shares with another man named [Urlaster Ghann](NPCs/urlaster-ghann).
